# Note Taking App

I wanted to learn more about fullstack development and backend / frontedns in egneral, so I thought I would start with a classic - the note taking app!

Dont judge my shitty code..

Example /.env file:

```.env
DATABASE_URL="your_database_file.sqlite"
```

Todo:

- [ ] Creating notes
- [ ] Retrieving notes
- [ ] Updating notes
- [ ] Deleting notes
- [ ] Frontend intergration
- [ ] Tags / filtering?
